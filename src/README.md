##JAVA EXERCISE

And the challenge begins.

There is one task in this test assignment. The description for it is given in the README-TA-JAVA-TASK.pdf file. Solve as much as you can - a partial solution is better than no solution. In addition to making your code work, make it clean as well.

Good luck!
