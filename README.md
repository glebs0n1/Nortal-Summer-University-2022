Welcome to Nortal Summer University 2022 Q/A thread. <BR> 
  
</h4>Hummingbird Travel</H4>
Hummingbirds are tiny birds that can travel about 2200 kilometers without having to stop. It’s about 29 million
times the length of their body.<br> Meanwhile, the marathon-trained developer has a ratio of around 25 thousand.<br>
You’re a curious traveler who found a strange species of these little birds. When gathered, they seem to form
a rectangular shape.<br> It moves in a strange, but beautiful and organized way. You notice the patterns and
understand that it’s a game! As a passionate developer, you start to think about the algorithm that is happening
here. You decide to calculate how long this ‘dance’ will last.<br>
</h4>Setup<.h4>
On Windows, execute './gradlew build'. On Linux execute 'gradlew build'. You can also use your own locally
installed Gradle, but it might result in mismatching the Gradle project root folder. Alternatively, skip these
previous steps by installing a smart IDE, like IntelliJ IDEA, which automates it.
Assignment
